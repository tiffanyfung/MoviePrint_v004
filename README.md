### Privacy
MoviePrint does not collect any data. All work including detection is done in the app itself (Note: It currently connets on startup to fonts.googleapis.com due to a dependency to semantic ui a ui framework.)

## Download Mac and Windows releases
https://github.com/fakob/MoviePrint_v004/releases

old version (2014)
http://www.fakob.com/2014/movieprint-an-osx-tool/

---
MoviePrint_v004 is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

#### For development

* The app was tested on Mac OSX and Windows. Running and building it on other platforms might require additional changes to the code. Especially when it comes to linking and packaging the libraries.
* For other details check [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) documentation

##### Mac setup

1. clone the repo via git: `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/fakob/MoviePrint_v004.git MoviePrint_v004`
2. Make sure you have cmake installed `brew install cmake`
3. To have ffmpeg support in opencv4nodejs you need to have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) v3.4.2 and pkg-config installed before opencv4nodejs gets built ([ffmpeg v4.x is currently not supported](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/opencv4nodejs/issues/503))
4. Enter the folder `cd MoviePrint_v004`
5. Install dependencies with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) by running the command `yarn`

##### Windows setup

These instructions should work, if you run into errors maybe [look here](https://github.com/fakob/MoviePrint_v004/issues/1#issuecomment-449582453) and comment.

1. `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/fakob/MoviePrint_v004.git MoviePrint_v004`
2. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (v3.13.2 works), choose "add to PATH" option during installation
3. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (v1.12.3 works) installed
4. To have ffmpeg support in opencv4nodejs you need to have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed (v3.4.2 works, v4.1 should too)
5. We'll need [opencv4nodejs](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/opencv4nodejs#on-windows) to work which requires `npm install --global windows-build-tools`
6. We need [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/126) to work which additionally requires VC++ 2015.3 v14.00(v140) toolset for desktop
   - Start Visual Studio Installer
   - Modify Visual Studio Build Tools 2017
   - Click on Individual components
   - Tick VC++ 2015.3 v14.00 (v140) toolset for desktop
   - Click on Modify/Install
7. Make sure you have [python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (_not 3_) installed (v2.7.15 works), test by running `python --version`
8. Run the command `yarn` (this may take 10+ minutes and may automatically download supporting libraries from Microsoft). If this process errors out, try to debug.

The rest of the instructions are the same for Mac and Windows:

##### First time

```bash
$ yarn includeInDist
```
##### Run

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

##### Packaging

To package the app for your local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```
